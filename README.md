# OptiDepth
### Accelerated Depth Estimation of Glass and Mirror Surfaces using Quantization.

## Tasks Performed
- Implemented FP-32 to FP-16 quantization on OAK-D camera for MirrorNet model and reduced the model’s memory size by 49.28%.
- Performed Post Training Quantization for the MirrorNet model achieving a reduction in the model’s memory size by 61.19% and an improvement in inference speed by 50.48%.
- Performed Post Training Quantization for the GDNet model achieving a reduction in the model’s memory size by 69.39% and an improvement in inference speed by 51.06%.
- Implemented a joint model structure using Quantized MirrorNet and GDNet models.
